  "summary": "No permission system â†’ Complete UI state management with extension-to-UI permission flow and logging verification",
  "root_cause": "System lacked user permission controls for AI tool execution, creating security gap and poor user experience when tools needed authorization",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Event-driven state management with extension-side detection, UI-side coordination, and bridge mapping to create secure permission flow",
    "key_changes": [
      "ui-state.ts: Created comprehensive state management types with UIState union, PermissionRequest interface, and validation helpers",
      "UIStateCoordinator.js: Implemented central state machine with transition validation, permission tracking, and event-driven state changes",
      "ConversationBuilder.ts: Added permission error detection with isPermissionError() method and needsPermission flag in tool results",
      "ConversationProcessor.ts: Enhanced to emit permission request events when needsPermission is detected in tool results",
      "EventMapper.js: Added missing mapPermissionRequest() method to bridge extension permission events to UI event bus",
      "ExtensionTypes.ts: Extended ToolResult interface with needsPermission optional boolean property for type safety"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "Verified complete round trip: Extension logs show permission detection and event emission, UI logs show state transitions but revealed missing EventMapper bridging which was then fixed",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Permission events from extension weren't reaching UI despite host-side detection working correctly",
      "solution": "Added missing 'chat.permission.request.v1' mapping in EventMapper.js incomingEventMap and implemented mapPermissionRequest() method",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "TypeScript compilation failed due to needsPermission property not existing on ToolResult interface",
      "solution": "Extended ToolResult interface in ExtensionTypes.ts with needsPermission?: boolean optional property",
      "category": "typing",
      "severity": "medium"
    }
