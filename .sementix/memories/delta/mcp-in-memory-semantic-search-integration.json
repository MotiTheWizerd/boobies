    "technical": "3: Integrated existing BasicEmbeddingService with MCP server, requiring understanding of embedding systems, search algorithms, and service architecture",

  "outcomes": {
    "performance_impact": "Lazy initialization - first search loads all memories and generates embeddings (one-time cost), subsequent searches are fast using cached embeddings",

  "summary": "MCP server using ChromaDB (not implemented yet) → In-memory semantic search with real Google embeddings and file-based caching, enabling Claude to query development memories",
  "root_cause": "Initial implementation assumed ChromaDB would be ready, but project uses in-memory search with BasicEmbeddingService instead",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Replace ChromaDB-dependent services with existing BasicEmbeddingService, leverage lazy initialization for performance, use file-based embedding cache",
    "key_changes": [
      "SharedServiceManager.ts: Replaced SearchMainService/ChromaCoordinator/SystemMainMonitor with BasicEmbeddingService singleton, added lazy initialization and reload capabilities",
      "MemoryService.ts: Updated to use BasicEmbeddingService.search() with 0.3 similarity threshold, auto-initializes on first query",
      "ResultFormatter.ts: Adapted to BasicSearchResult type, displays similarity percentages and embedding text snippets"

  "validation": "TypeScript build successful, all imports resolved correctly, service architecture follows existing patterns",

    {
      "issue": "Initially tried to use SearchMainService which depends on ChromaDB that isn't implemented yet",

  "lesson": "The codebase already had the perfect solution (BasicEmbeddingService) - research existing code before building new abstractions. Ultra-modular architecture makes integration trivial when you find the right components.",
