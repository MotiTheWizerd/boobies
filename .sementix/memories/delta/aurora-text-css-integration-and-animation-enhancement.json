"summary": "Static 'Thinking....' text in typing indicator → Aurora gradient animated 'Processing...' with jumping dots",
"root_cause": "Typing indicator lacked visual polish and engaging animation to match the sophisticated VS Code extension interface",

"solution": {
"approach": "Integrate aurora-text.css into VS Code extension resource system and enhance typing indicator with animated text effects",
"key_changes": [
"ResourceManager.ts: Added auroraText URI mapping to texts-effects/aurora-text.css with proper VS Code webview resource handling",
"base.html: Added {{AURORA_TEXT_CSS_URI}} link tag for aurora text effect stylesheet injection",
"AgentMessagesManager.js: Changed placeholder text from 'Thinking....' to 'Processing...' with aurora-flow class and jumping dots animation",
"aurora-text.css: Added gentleJump keyframes and dots-jumping classes for animated ellipsis dots with staggered delays",
"spinner-grid.css: Reduced matrix cell size from 4px to 2.5px for better proportional balance with text",
"ui-messages-list.css: Adjusted placeholder-content gap from 8px to 2.5px for tighter component spacing"
]
},

"validation": "Visual confirmation in both typing-indicator-demo.html and VS Code extension showing aurora gradient text with jumping dots animation",

"gotchas": [
{
"issue": "Initial aurora-text.css was not available in VS Code extension webview due to missing resource registration",
"solution": "Added complete resource pipeline: URI mapping in ResourceManager.ts, template placeholder in base.html, and replacement in injectResources method",
"category": "integration",
"severity": "medium"
},
{
"issue": "Text size and spacing needed fine-tuning to balance with matrix spinner animation",
"solution": "Reduced font-size to 11px, adjusted grid cells to 2.5px, and tightened gap spacing for visual harmony",
"category": "configuration",
"severity": "low"
}
],

"lesson": "VS Code extension CSS integration requires proper resource management pipeline - URI mapping, template placeholders, and replacement methods must all be coordinated for external stylesheets to work correctly",

"aurora-text.css - add new gradient color schemes and animation timing variations",
