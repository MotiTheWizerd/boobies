  "outcomes": {
    "performance_impact": "Positive impact - eliminated hardcoded 31-file array, now dynamically loads 49 files from filesystem",

  "summary": "Run Test button failing with VS Code API conflicts and missing bridge commands â†’ Fixed API acquisition method and implemented complete bridge communication chain",
  "root_cause": "VSCodeBridge attempted to call acquireVsCodeApi() when extension had already acquired it, plus missing getMemoryFiles command in extension bridge handler",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Fix VS Code API conflict by using existing window.vscode instance, then implement missing bridge command with comprehensive logging",
    "key_changes": [
      "VSCodeBridge.js: Modified getVSCodeApi() to use existing window.vscode instead of acquiring new API instance",
      "MemorySearchExtensionBridge.ts: Added getMemoryFiles case to switch statement and implemented filesystem scanning method",
      "MemorySearchProvider.ts: Enhanced loadConfig() with detailed logging to debug workspace and settings issues",
      "Multiple files: Added comprehensive logging throughout bridge communication chain for debugging"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "Successfully resolved VS Code API conflict, extension now finds 49 memory files in correct workspace, bridge communication established",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "VS Code extension development uses Extension Development Host with different workspace than development workspace",

    {
      "issue": "Extension calls acquireVsCodeApi() during initialization, WebView cannot acquire again due to VS Code single-acquisition rule",

      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Logger class only has info/debug/error methods, no warn method causing TypeScript compilation errors",

    {
      "issue": "Bridge message responses not reaching WebView despite extension processing commands successfully",
