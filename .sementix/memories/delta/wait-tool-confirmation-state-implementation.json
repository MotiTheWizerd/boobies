  "summary": "Permission dialog disappearing immediately after user action due to race condition → Added wait_tool_confirmation state for proper UI flow with instant user feedback",
  "root_cause": "Extension was immediately setting UI state back to 'active' upon receiving permission response, causing ConfirmationController to hide dialog before user could see result of their action",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Staged implementation adding new UI state to provide immediate user feedback while maintaining event-driven architecture and proper separation of concerns",
    "key_changes": [
      "ui-state.ts: Added 'wait_tool_confirmation' to UIState type and validation helper for new workflow state",
      "ConfirmationController.js: Modified handleAllow/handleDeny to immediately emit wait_tool_confirmation state and hide dialog before sending response to extension",
      "ConfirmationController.js: Updated handleUIStateChange with comprehensive switch statement for all state transitions",
      "LogicManager.ts: Removed immediate 'active' state setting, added simulated processing time before returning to active state"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "Implemented complete state flow testing from permission_needed → wait_tool_confirmation → active with proper dialog visibility management",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Initial suggestion to remove state-driven dialog visibility would have broken event-driven architecture",
      "solution": "Moti correctly insisted on maintaining event-driven design and adding proper state instead of architectural shortcuts",

      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Race condition between UI immediate response and extension state changes required careful event sequencing",
      "solution": "UI emits state change first for instant feedback, then sends business response to extension",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "medium"
    }
  ],

  "lesson": "Proper event-driven architecture requires resisting shortcuts that break design patterns. UI should own immediate feedback, business logic should own processing, with clear state boundaries between them.",
