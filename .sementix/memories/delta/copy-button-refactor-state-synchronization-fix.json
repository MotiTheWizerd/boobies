  "summary": "Copy button not copying results after refactor → Fixed state synchronization between legacy SearchPageController.currentResults and ViewModeManager.currentResults",
  "root_cause": "Ultra-modular refactor created new ViewModeManager.currentResults state but legacy SearchPageController.currentResults was never updated, remaining as empty array [], which overwrote valid results during sort operations",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Synchronize state between legacy controller and refactored component by reading from ViewModeManager.currentResults instead of stale SearchPageController.currentResults",
    "key_changes": [
      "SearchPageController.sortAndDisplayResults(): Changed to read results from viewModeManager.currentResults instead of this.currentResults to prevent overwriting valid results with empty array",
      "SearchPageController.performSearch(): Added this.currentResults = this.viewModeManager.currentResults to maintain backward compatibility by syncing legacy state after search completes"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "Code trace confirmed flow: performSearch() → SearchCoordinator → ResultDisplayCoordinator → viewModeManager.setCurrentResults() stores valid results, sortAndDisplayResults() now correctly reads from viewModeManager instead of stale legacy state",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "ResultsCopyHandler.copyAllResults() reads from viewModeManager.currentResults, but sortAndDisplayResults() was passing SearchPageController.currentResults (empty []) which overwrote the valid results",
      "solution": "Changed sortAndDisplayResults() to read from viewModeManager.currentResults before passing to resultDisplay.sortAndDisplay(), preventing empty array from overwriting valid results",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "high"

    {
      "issue": "Legacy state SearchPageController.currentResults was initialized to [] and never updated after refactor, breaking backward compatibility assumptions",

      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "medium"

  "lesson": "When refactoring monolithic controllers into orchestrator+components pattern, carefully audit all legacy state properties that may have external dependencies - they need explicit synchronization from new component state to maintain backward compatibility and prevent data loss",
