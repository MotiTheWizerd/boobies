"summary": "Need for semantic search across development memories → Complete AI-powered memory search system with Google embeddings, ChromaDB storage, and interactive dashboard",

"gotchas": [
{
"issue": "Mock embedding generation in browser not creating consistent enough vectors for exact word matches like 'event' or 'EmbeddingService'",

"category": "integration",
"severity": "medium"

{
"issue": "CSS path references incorrect when base.css moved to different location in dashboard structure",

"severity": "low"
