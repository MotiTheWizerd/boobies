  "summary": "Attempted createRequire implementation to load CommonJS from ESM → TypeScript compiler removes require calls, built output still has ESM imports",
  "root_cause": "TypeScript's compiler resolves require() calls at compile time when it can infer the module type. Since we're importing from TypeScript source files (not .js), TypeScript 'helpfully' converts require() back to import statements in the output, defeating the purpose of createRequire",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Multiple attempts: (1) Top-level const require with createRequire - compiled away, (2) Function-wrapped loadModules() - also compiled away, (3) Planned: Dynamic import() for runtime resolution",
    "key_changes": [
      "MemoryService.ts: Added createRequire with loadModules() function to defer module loading to runtime",
      "ResultFormatter.ts: Added createRequire for loading BasicEmbeddingService types",
      "Both files: TypeScript compiled but output still contains import statements instead of require()"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "FAILED - TypeScript builds successfully but generated JavaScript still has ESM imports, Node.js runtime error unchanged: 'Cannot find module SharedServiceManager.js'",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "TypeScript compiler is too smart - it sees require('../../../../dist/...') and checks if that path exists as TypeScript source. When it finds the .ts file, it resolves it at compile time and emits an import statement instead of preserving require(). This defeats createRequire pattern",
      "solution": "UNRESOLVED - Need to use dynamic import() or configure TypeScript to not resolve these specific imports",
      "category": "configuration",
      "severity": "critical"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Wrapping require in a function (loadModules()) doesn't prevent TypeScript from resolving it. TypeScript does static analysis and still converts to import even when require is in function scope",
      "solution": "UNRESOLVED - May need to use string concatenation or dynamic import() to truly defer resolution to runtime",
      "category": "configuration",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "The path ../../../../dist/ext/modules/memory-search/... exists during development (TypeScript can see the source), so TypeScript helpfully resolves it. If we pointed to a path that doesn't exist in source, TypeScript would error",
      "solution": "Catch-22: TypeScript won't let us reference non-existent paths at compile time, but will resolve existent paths and convert require to import",
      "category": "configuration",
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ],

  "lesson": "createRequire pattern works in pure JavaScript but TypeScript's compiler interferes. TypeScript's module resolution is very aggressive - it will try to resolve and convert require() calls to import statements when it can statically analyze the code. To use createRequire with TypeScript: (1) Use dynamic import() instead - truly runtime, TypeScript can't resolve, (2) Point to .js files that don't have corresponding .ts files, (3) Use string concatenation to hide the path from TypeScript's static analysis, (4) Disable TypeScript's module resolution for specific files. Tomorrow: Try dynamic import() approach which TypeScript can't optimize away.",
