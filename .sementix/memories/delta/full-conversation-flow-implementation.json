  "summary": "Single final response output → complete 9-message conversation flow with tool visibility and streaming simulation",
  "root_cause": "Users only saw final Claude responses without understanding the problem-solving process, tool usage, or step-by-step reasoning that led to the answer",

    "approach": "Parse complete Claude Code response array into universal conversation message types, then stream them individually to UI with tool action visibility and formatted presentation",
    "key_changes": [
      "ExtensionTypes.ts: Added ConversationMessage interface with 5 message types (reasoning, agent_message, tool_use_start, tool_use_end, final_result) and universal action mapping (read, write, search, execute, analyze)",
      "MockProvider.ts: Implemented parseFullResponse() method that converts Claude Code JSON array into structured conversation messages with tool mapping from Claude-specific (Read, Bash, Glob) to universal actions",
      "LogicManager.ts: Added conversation message processing with sendConversationMessagesToUI() method that streams messages individually with 200ms delays and emoji formatting for different message types"

  "validation": "Successfully parsed 9 conversation messages from Claude Code response.json and streamed them to UI showing complete tool usage flow: Read attempt → error → agent reasoning → Bash command → result → Glob search → success → final answer",
