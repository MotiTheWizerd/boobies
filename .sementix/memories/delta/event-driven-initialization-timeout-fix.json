    "business": "5: Critical blocker - system initialization timeout prevented entire feature from working, users couldn't initialize the 63-file embedding system",

  "summary": "30-second request timeout during 63-file initialization → Event-driven architecture with immediate response + background processing + real-time progress events",
  "root_cause": "SystemCommandHandler awaited full initialization completion (~30s for 63 files with API calls) before returning response, exceeding VSCodeBridge 30s timeout. MessageReceiver couldn't postMessage until async handler completed, blocking entire UI thread.",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Convert blocking request-response to event-driven architecture: pass webview panel reference through dependency chain, return immediately from handler, spawn background task that sends progress/completion events directly to webview",
    "key_changes": [
      "CommandContext.ts: Added webviewPanel?: vscode.WebviewPanel to context interface for event communication",
      "DependencyContainer.ts: Added setWebviewPanel() method and storage, passes panel in getDependencies()",
      "MessageReceiver.ts: Calls provider.setWebviewPanel(panel) on setup to inject panel reference",
      "MessageTypes.ts: Added ProgressMessage and CompletionMessage event types (initProgress, initComplete)",
      "SystemCommandHandler.ts: execute() returns immediately with {status:'started'}, spawns startBackgroundInitialization() that sends panel.webview.postMessage() events",
      "SearchPageController.js: Added setupInitializationEventListeners() + handleInitProgress() + handleInitComplete() to receive events",
      "ApiConfig.ts: Fixed Google API from v1beta/:embedText to v1/:embedContent (bonus fix for 400 errors)",
      "RequestBuilder.ts: Removed invalid 'model' field from request body for v1 API compatibility"

    {
      "issue": "Initial approach tried increasing timeout or removing delays, but didn't address architectural blocking issue",

      "severity": "high"

    {
      "issue": "Webview panel reference needed to be passed through 5-layer dependency chain",
