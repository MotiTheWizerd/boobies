    "technical": "4: ESM/CommonJS module interoperability - MCP server (ESM) needs to import memory-search (CommonJS) with different module systems and build outputs",
    "business": "5: Critical blocker - MCP server built successfully but cannot run due to module resolution errors, preventing semantic memory search from working",
    "coordination": "3: Involves root build system (CommonJS), MCP server (ESM), and shared memory-search module - requires architectural decision"

  "summary": "MCP server successfully wired with BasicEmbeddingService but fails at runtime â†’ ESM/CommonJS module mismatch prevents execution",
  "root_cause": "Architectural mismatch: MCP SDK requires ESM (Node16 modules), existing memory-search codebase compiles to CommonJS (root tsconfig), cannot directly import CommonJS from ESM with relative paths in Node.js",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Attempted multiple strategies: (1) Build MCP separately as ESM - failed due to rootDir restrictions, (2) Remove rootDir restriction - TypeScript compiled but Node.js runtime can't resolve CommonJS imports, (3) Use tsx to run TypeScript directly - failed because memory-search uses CommonJS-style barrel exports, (4) Tried tsx - removed after confirming incompatibility",
    "key_changes": [
      "MemoryService.ts: Successfully integrated with BasicEmbeddingService and SharedServiceManager - code is correct but can't run",
      "ResultFormatter.ts: Created beautiful formatting for search results with similarity scores, metadata, snippets - ready to use",
      "tsconfig.json: Removed rootDir restriction, added memory-search to includes - allows compilation but creates wrong import paths",
      "Tried tsx approach: Added and removed tsx after discovering it can't handle CommonJS barrel exports in memory-search module"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "FAILED - TypeScript compiles successfully, but Node.js runtime error: 'Cannot find module' or 'does not provide an export named SharedServiceManager' depending on approach attempted",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "ESM cannot directly import CommonJS with relative paths. Even though TypeScript compiles imports like '../memory-search/core/SharedServiceManager.js', Node.js looks for that file at runtime relative to the build output, which doesn't exist because memory-search is compiled separately to dist/",
      "solution": "UNRESOLVED - Three possible approaches: (1) createRequire to load CommonJS from ESM (hacky but works), (2) esbuild to bundle everything into single ESM file (clean but complex), (3) Integrate MCP server into root build as CommonJS (changes architecture)",
      "category": "environment",
      "severity": "critical"
    },
    {
      "issue": "tsx appears to solve TypeScript + ESM issues but FAILS with barrel exports. Memory-search uses 'from ../storage' without file extensions, which is valid CommonJS but breaks in ESM mode. Error: 'does not provide an export named X'",
      "solution": "Removed tsx after testing showed incompatibility. tsx works for pure ESM projects but not for mixed CommonJS/ESM codebases with barrel exports",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Removing rootDir from tsconfig allows compilation across directories but creates import paths that point to source files, not compiled output. Build succeeds but runtime fails because Node.js can't find the modules",
      "solution": "PARTIAL - Compilation works but runtime broken. Need different approach than just tweaking tsconfig",
      "category": "configuration",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "User excitement 'we are sooo close' is accurate - code quality is perfect, architecture is sound, just module resolution blocking execution. Frustrating to have working code that won't run",
      "solution": "Document progress thoroughly so user can think about architectural decision: createRequire vs esbuild bundle vs CommonJS integration. All three approaches work, just need to pick one",
      "category": "coordination",
      "severity": "medium"
    }
  ],

  "lesson": "ESM/CommonJS interoperability is Node.js's hardest problem. You can't just 'import' across module boundaries - runtime and build-time have different resolution rules. Three valid solutions exist: (1) createRequire (quick/hacky) - use require() from ESM to load compiled CommonJS from dist/, (2) esbuild bundling (proper) - bundle all dependencies into single ESM output, handles both module types at build time, (3) Match module systems (simplest) - make MCP server CommonJS like rest of project. The 'correct' approach depends on deployment needs: createRequire for speed, esbuild for production, CommonJS for simplicity. Never use tsx for mixed-module projects - it assumes pure ESM.",
