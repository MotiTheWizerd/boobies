  "summary": "Monolithic 180-line events file → Scalable 20-file category-based architecture enabling infinite team growth",
  "root_cause": "Single events.js file created bottleneck for team development - all developers needed to modify same file, causing merge conflicts and limiting scalability as new event types were added",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "8-stage category-based extraction: directory structure → chat events → tool events → status/input events → component events → validation/registry → barrel export → verification",
    "key_changes": [
      "events.js: Transformed from monolithic definitions to clean barrel export with backward compatibility",
      "categories/chat/: Split chat events into 3 focused files (types, constants, factories) for team ownership",
      "categories/tool/: Extracted tool events into dedicated category with clean separation",
      "categories/status/: Status and boot events organized for independent development",
      "categories/input/: Input interaction events isolated for UI team ownership",
      "categories/component/: Component-specific events ready for individual component teams",
      "registry/EventRegistry.js: Central registry combining all event maps with validation helpers",
      "validation/EventValidator.js: Centralized validation logic with extensible patterns"

  "validation": "Comprehensive functional testing via Node.js verification - all 17 events preserved, imports working, factories functional, validation operational, backward compatibility confirmed",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Import path depth calculation - nested category structure required careful relative path adjustments for cross-module imports",
      "solution": "Systematically calculated import depths: categories need '../../../' to reach base modules, registry needs '../categories/' for category imports",
