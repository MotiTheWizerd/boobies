  "summary": "Permission dialog disappearing when agent sent messages → Complete multi-state architecture with independent agent and permission state tracks",
  "root_cause": "Single monolithic UIState caused agent activity (agent_busy) to override permission workflow (permission_needed), hiding dialog before user could respond. Extension and UI had conflicting state managers that didn't communicate.",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Separation of concerns: Split single state into two independent tracks (agent activity + permission workflow) with Extension as single source of truth and UI as dumb renderer",
    "key_changes": [
      "UIStateManager.ts: Refactored from single UIState to multi-state manager with agentState (active/busy) and permissionState (idle/pending/processing/resolved)",
      "ui-state.ts: Added AgentState, PermissionState types and new event contracts (AgentStateChangePayload, PermissionStateChangePayload)",
      "LogicManager.ts: Replaced setUIState() with setAgentState() and setPermissionState() methods emitting specific events (ui.agent.state.change.v1, ui.permission.state.change.v1)",
      "ConversationProcessor.ts: Removed all state validation checks, now unconditionally emits agent state changes and permission state changes independently",
      "ConfirmationController.js: Changed from listening to ui.state.change.v1 to ONLY ui.permission.state.change.v1 - pure renderer reacting to permission state",
      "StatusController.js: Changed from listening to ui.state.change.v1 to ONLY ui.agent.state.change.v1 - pure renderer showing agent activity",
      "UserUIController.js: Changed from listening to ui.state.change.v1 to ONLY ui.agent.state.change.v1 - enables/disables input based on agent activity",
      "MessageValidator.js: Added ui.agent.state.change.v1 and ui.permission.state.change.v1 to knownIncomingEvents",
      "EventMapper.js: Added mapAgentStateChange() and mapPermissionStateChange() methods for new event types",
      "Logger.ts: Added warn() method with yellow console.warn output for state transition warnings"

  "validation": "TypeScript compilation successful with no errors. Visual confirmation in UI showing permission dialog persisting through multiple agent messages.",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Initial attempt used state transition validation (canTransitionTo) but this prevented independent state updates",

      "severity": "high"

    {
      "issue": "ConversationProcessor was directly emitting ui.state.change.v1 events without updating UIStateManager, causing state desync",
