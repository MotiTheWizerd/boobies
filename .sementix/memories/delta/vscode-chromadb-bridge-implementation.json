"summary": "Isolated real ChromaDB system â†’ Unified bridge connecting production backend to glassmorphism UI",
"root_cause": "Complete architectural separation between Node.js core services and browser WebView interface prevented real system utilization",

"solution": {
"approach": "Bridge pattern with progressive enhancement - auto-detects environment and provides seamless fallback from real to mock systems",
"key_changes": [
"MemorySearchExtensionBridge.ts: Extension-side message handler delegating to existing MemorySearchProvider for zero architectural disruption",
"VSCodeBridge.js: WebView-side communication layer with VS Code API detection and graceful mock fallback",
"UnifiedSearchOrchestrator.js: Mode-switching orchestrator providing identical API while auto-selecting real vs mock backend",
"memory-search-browser.js: Single line change from BrowserMemorySearchOrchestrator to UnifiedSearchOrchestrator for seamless integration",
"HTML files: Added bridge script imports while maintaining existing script loading order"
]
},

"validation": "Bridge successfully switches between real and mock modes based on environment detection, maintains backward compatibility with existing glassmorphism UI",

"gotchas": [
{
"issue": "VS Code WebView requires acquireVsCodeApi() for extension communication, not available in regular browser environments",

"architecture_decisions": {
"bridge_pattern": "Chosen over direct integration to maintain clean separation and enable progressive enhancement with fallbacks",
