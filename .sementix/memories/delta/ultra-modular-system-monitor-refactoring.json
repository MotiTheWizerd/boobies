"summary": "Monolithic 188-line SystemMonitor → Ultra-modular architecture with 11 focused micro-components averaging 33 lines each, perfect for neural network visualization",
"root_cause": "Single large monitor handling multiple responsibilities: health checking, metrics collection, status aggregation, performance analysis, and statistics management - difficult to visualize, test, and maintain as discrete neural network nodes",

"solution": {
"approach": "Deep 6-level modular extraction with types/health/metrics/status/insights/management separation, each component representing a specialized neural monitoring node",
"key_changes": [
"SystemMainMonitor.ts: Slim monitor (58 lines) orchestrating specialized micro-services while maintaining clean API",
"types/MonitorTypes.ts: Type definitions (30 lines) - pure interface specifications for monitoring neural node contracts",
"health/: HealthChecker (36 lines), ServiceHealthAggregator (36 lines) - distributed health monitoring neural cluster",
"metrics/: MetricsStorage (31 lines), MetricsCollector (32 lines), MetricsCalculator (49 lines) - performance data neural pipeline",

"insights/: PerformanceAnalyzer (70 lines), RecommendationEngine (55 lines) - analysis and recommendation neural engines",
"management/StatsManager.ts: Statistics control and lifecycle neural operations (32 lines)"
