  "summary": "Static final responses → Dynamic streaming tool visualization showing Claude's complete problem-solving process with real-time state transitions",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "6-stage architectural implementation: contract definition → backend event routing → UI event handling → component management → debugging → integration testing",
    "key_changes": [
      "chat.json: Added chat.tool_start.v1 and chat.tool_end.v1 event contracts with structured payloads",
      "chat.ts: Created ChatToolStartPayload and ChatToolEndPayload TypeScript interfaces with toolId, action, target, params, result fields",
      "LogicManager.ts: Replaced text formatting with switch statement routing tool events to specialized UI events with structured data",
      "BridgeHandler.js: Added chat.tool_start.v1 and chat.tool_end.v1 event handlers emitting internal UI_EVENTS.TOOL_USE_START/END",
      "ToolManager.js: Complete component system managing tool lifecycle with Map-based toolId tracking, dynamic DOM creation/updates, and comprehensive logging",
      "MockProvider.ts: Enhanced with toolMap for proper action matching between tool_use_start and tool_use_end events",
      "ExtensionTypes.ts: Added toolId field to ToolInfo interface for unique tool operation identification",
      "Logger.js: Added warn() method to complete logging interface"
