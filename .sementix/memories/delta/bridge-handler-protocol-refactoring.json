  "summary": "159-line monolithic protocol handler → 5-component protocol architecture but with concerning 3x code expansion",
  "root_cause": "Single BridgeHandler file created merge conflicts for teams adding different protocol events (chat, tool, status) and mixed transport, validation, and mapping concerns",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Protocol layer separation: validation → transport → mapping → processing with orchestrated message flow",
    "key_changes": [
      "BridgeHandler.js: Transformed from monolithic switch statement to clean orchestrator delegating to specialized processors",
      "validation/MessageValidator.js: Extracted message structure validation with extensible event type registry",
      "transport/MessageTransport.js: Isolated message sending infrastructure with error handling and batch operations",
      "mapping/EventMapper.js: Separated bridge ↔ UI event translation logic with bidirectional mapping tables",
      "incoming/IncomingProcessor.js: Dedicated bridge → UI message processing pipeline with validation and emission",
      "outgoing/OutgoingProcessor.js: Specialized UI → bridge event setup with mapping and transport coordination"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "Comprehensive protocol testing via Node.js verification - all message types processed, validation working, transport functional, mapping bidirectional, backward compatibility preserved",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Code expansion concern - 159 lines became ~500+ lines across components with 3x growth for same functionality",
      "solution": "Identified root cause as enterprise pattern tax - wrapped simple switch logic in object-oriented infrastructure layers adding ceremony without core logic growth",

    {
      "issue": "TypeScript unused variable warnings in mapExtensionAck, mapHealthPing, and EventValidator payload parameters",

      "severity": "low"
    }
  ],

  "lesson": "CRITICAL: Refactoring can create over-engineering - 36 lines of core logic became 500+ lines with 'enterprise ceremony'. Sometimes simple switch statements are the right level of complexity. Question whether team scalability benefits justify 3x code bloat.",
