  "summary": "Demonstrated recursive self-improvement: Sementix semantic search guided refactoring of Sementix itself, with Claude learning refactoring patterns from its own past work to create 52 micro-components across two major files",
  "root_cause": "First experience with semantic-search-guided refactoring workflow revealed the power of AI learning from its own documented experiences to improve itself",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Meta-learning workflow: user provides semantic query → system returns relevant past refactoring patterns → Claude applies and extends patterns → documents new memory → future Claude learns from it",
    "key_changes": [
      "EmbeddingExtractor.js: 153 lines → 12 micro-components (extractors, strategies, utilities) averaging 25 lines each",
      "SearchPageController.js: 785 lines → 40 micro-components across 9 architectural layers (bridge, events, search, results, state, history, filters, ui, facade) averaging 37 lines each",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Initial EmbeddingExtractor refactoring completed quickly (12 components) but SearchPageController scale (40 components) required batched todo tracking to avoid overwhelming granularity",

    {
      "issue": "Realized halfway through SearchPageController that past refactoring memories included anti-pattern warning (bridge-handler over-engineering) showing memory system captures failures too",

  "lesson": "Semantic memory-guided refactoring creates recursive self-improvement loop: system uses own past patterns to improve itself, each refactoring makes future refactorings better.
