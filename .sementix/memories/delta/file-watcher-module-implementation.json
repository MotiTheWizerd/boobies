  "lesson": "CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN - Isolated Module Principle: FileWatcher has ZERO knowledge of memories, embeddings, MCP, or any domain logic. It only knows paths and callbacks. This isolation enables: (1) Any module can use it via DI (memory-search, mcp-server, config watchers), (2) Easy testing with mock callbacks, (3) Single Responsibility - does one thing perfectly, (4) Future-proof - adding new watch consumers requires zero FileWatcher changes. DI Integration Pattern: Services registered in DISetup.createContainer() become system-wide singletons resolvable via TOKENS - enables loose coupling, dependency injection for testability, and consistent lifecycle management. This pattern should guide ALL future infrastructure modules.",
