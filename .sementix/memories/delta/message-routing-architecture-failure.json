"summary": "Working typing indicator system + attempted routing architecture → Broken indicator functionality with no placeholder creation",
"root_cause": "Over-engineered solution that introduced double event handling and timing issues while the original AgentTypingIndicatorController was working correctly",

"solution": {
"approach": "Created MessageManagerRouter to centralize event routing and moved ui.state.change.v1 handling from AgentTypingIndicatorController to AgentMessagesManager",
"key_changes": [
"MessageManagerRouter.js: Created new router listening to ui.state.change.v1 and CHAT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED events",
"AgentMessagesManager.js: Added createPlaceholder/clearPlaceholder methods and event listening (then removed)",
"UIControllerManager.js: Added router registration and dependency injection system",
"AgentTypingIndicatorController: Removed from controller registration (functionality moved)"

"validation": "Failed - logs show 'Appended agent message (no placeholder)' and no agent_busy state routing visible",

{
"issue": "agent_busy state never appears in logs - only see active state, suggesting timing or initialization issues",
