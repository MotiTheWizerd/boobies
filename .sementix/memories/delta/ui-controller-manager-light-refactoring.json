  "summary": "142-line repetitive controller manager â†’ 120-line configuration-driven implementation with design consistency folder structure",
  "root_cause": "Hardcoded controller initialization patterns and duplicated lifecycle method implementations across start/stop/destroy operations",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Light refactoring with configuration extraction and helper method creation - maintained single file structure to avoid over-engineering",
    "key_changes": [
      "UIControllerManager.js: Extracted controller configurations into array to eliminate repetitive new/set patterns in initialization",
      "UIControllerManager.js: Created executeControllerLifecycleMethod helper to DRY up start/stop/destroy forEach operations",

  "validation": "Manual testing via mock verification script - confirmed configuration-driven initialization, lifecycle helper functionality, and import path resolution",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Moving file to subfolder broke relative import paths - UIControllerManager imports were looking in wrong directories causing 404 errors",
