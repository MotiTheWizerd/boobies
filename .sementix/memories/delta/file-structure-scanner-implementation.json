  "summary": "User needed VS Code explorer-like file structure scanner → Created modular scanner with flat directory structure, multiple modes, and filtering options",
  "root_cause": "Existing file scanner created deeply nested JSON unsuitable for VS Code-like navigation interface",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Modular architecture with separate concerns: gitignore filtering, file analysis, scanning logic, and output formatting",
    "key_changes": [
      "gitignore-filter.js: Extracted reusable gitignore pattern matching from existing scanner",
      "scanner.js: Implemented flat directory structure where each folder level is separate JSON object",
      "file-analyzer.js: Created file categorization and metadata extraction with basic/full modes",
      "formatter.js: Built output formatting with unique ID generation and console reporting",
      "index.js: Main orchestrator with CLI argument parsing and mode selection",
      "package.json: Added npm scripts for different scanning modes"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "Tested all modes: full (283KB), basic (97KB), no-docs (262KB), clean (91KB). Verified VS Code-like flat structure with immediate children only per directory level",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Initial implementation created deep nested tree instead of flat VS Code explorer structure",
      "solution": "Restructured to store each directory level as separate object with only immediate children, not recursive nesting",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "medium"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Basic mode summary creation failed due to missing categories object",
      "solution": "Added mode-specific summary creation logic to handle basic vs full mode differences",
      "category": "typing",
      "severity": "low"
    }
  ],

  "lesson": "When building file structure tools, clarify the exact output format early - flat explorer-like vs nested tree structures require fundamentally different scanning approaches",
