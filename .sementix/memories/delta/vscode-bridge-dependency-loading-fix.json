    "technical": "1: Simple script tag ordering fix - identified missing dependency declarations and added them in correct sequence",
    "business": "4: Critical bug blocking all semantic search functionality across 4 dashboard views - NavigationController failing to load search page",
    "coordination": "2: Required updating 4 HTML files with identical 12-line script dependency block maintaining consistent ordering"

  "summary": "ReferenceError: WebViewLogger is not defined → 12 bridge dependency scripts loaded before VSCodeBridge.js in 4 HTML files",
  "root_cause": "VSCodeBridge refactoring promoted modular architecture but HTML files never updated - loaded VSCodeBridge.js directly without its 12 required dependencies (utils, core, commands, registry modules)",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Add complete dependency chain before VSCodeBridge.js in all HTML files - ensure utils→core→commands→registry→bridge loading order",
    "key_changes": [
      "search.html: Added 12 bridge dependency script tags before VSCodeBridge.js line 191 - enables SearchPageController to instantiate bridge without errors",
      "index.html: Added 12 bridge dependency script tags before VSCodeBridge.js line 120 - fixes dashboard initialization",
      "manager.html: Added 12 bridge dependency script tags before VSCodeBridge.js line 169 - enables manager view TestRunner",
      "test-integration.html: Added 12 bridge dependency script tags before VSCodeBridge.js line 36 - fixes integration test harness"

  "validation": "Error stack trace showed WebViewLogger undefined at VSCodeBridge.js:14:27 - after fix, all dependencies resolve and bridge constructor executes successfully",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Refactoring broke production immediately - VSCodeBridge promotion completed but HTML integration never tested before deployment",
      "solution": "Always verify script loading in browser after modular refactoring - check Network tab and console for dependency errors before considering migration complete",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "4 HTML files needed identical updates - easy to miss one or introduce inconsistent ordering across files",
      "solution": "Used grep to find all VSCodeBridge.js script tags, then applied identical 22-line block to each location maintaining exact dependency order",
      "category": "coordination",
      "severity": "medium"
