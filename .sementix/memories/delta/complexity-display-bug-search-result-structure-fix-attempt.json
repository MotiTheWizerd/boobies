"summary": "Complexity displaying as 'T:N/A B:N/A' in search results → Attempted structure normalization fix in MemorySearchExecutor but issue persists → Need diagnostic logging",
"root_cause": "Hypothesized inconsistent result structures between query and no-query search paths, but actual root cause still unconfirmed",

"solution": {
"approach": "Attempted to normalize result structure in no-query path to match SemanticSearchEngine output format with nested metadata object",
"key_changes": [
"MemorySearchExecutor.js:34-63: Changed no-query result mapping from spread operator to explicit nested structure matching SemanticSearchEngine format",
"MemorySearchExecutor.js:45-57: Created explicit metadata object with technical_complexity, business_complexity, coordination_complexity fields"
]
},

"validation": "User tested in browser - complexity still displays as 'T:N/A B:N/A', indicating fix did not resolve issue",

"gotchas": [
{
"issue": "Initial hypothesis about structure inconsistency may be incorrect - complexity still showing N/A after structure normalization",
"solution": "Next step: Add diagnostic logging to trace actual data values through the pipeline",
"category": "debugging",
"severity": "high"
},
{
"issue": "Made code changes without visibility into runtime data - blind debugging without logging",
"solution": "Need to add console.log statements to see: (1) memory.technical_complexity values in MemorySearchExecutor, (2) result.metadata values before UI render, (3) actual template interpolation values",
"category": "debugging",
"severity": "medium"
},
{
"issue": "Multiple code paths could be active - semantic search, text search, filter-only, or fallback paths",
"solution": "Add searchType logging to identify which code path is actually executing during user's test",
"category": "integration",
"severity": "medium"
}

"lesson": "When debugging display issues with multi-layer data flow, add diagnostic logging FIRST to confirm hypothesis before making code changes. Blind fixes based on code reading alone can miss runtime data issues like undefined source values or unexpected code paths.",
