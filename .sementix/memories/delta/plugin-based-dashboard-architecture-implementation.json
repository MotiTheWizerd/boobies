  "summary": "Memory-search-specific dashboard â†’ Plugin-based multi-feature platform with FeatureRegistry, dynamic sidebar building, and manifest-driven feature registration",
  "root_cause": "Beautiful memory-search dashboard was hardcoded for single feature, needed reuse for file-watcher and future features without duplicating 60+ component files and metallic UI system",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Create plugin architecture layer on top of existing ultra-modular system - FeatureRegistry stores feature manifests, SidebarController builds dynamically, NavigationController routes via registry",
    "key_changes": [
      "FeatureRegistry.js (89 lines): Singleton registry managing feature manifests with sidebar sections, views, routes - provides getAllSidebarSections(), findViewByRoute(), event system",
      "FeatureBootstrap.js (158 lines): Registers features before SPA initialization, contains memory-search manifest with 4 sidebar sections (Processing, Vector Database, Search & Query, Testing)",
      "SidebarController.plugin.js (192 lines): Replaced static HTML template loading with dynamic buildFromRegistry() that generates sidebar HTML from FeatureRegistry.getAllSidebarSections()",
      "NavigationController.plugin.js (285 lines): Replaced hardcoded route mapping with FeatureRegistry.findViewByRoute(), maintains existing loadDashboardView()/loadSearchView() for backward compatibility",
      "SPABootstrap.js: Added Step 0 calling FeatureBootstrap.bootstrap() before manifest loading, registers features first then loads UI",
      "ManifestRegistry.js: Updated to load NavigationController.plugin.js and SidebarController.plugin.js instead of original versions",
      "index.html: Added FeatureRegistry.js and FeatureBootstrap.js script tags before existing bootstrap loaders",
      "NavigationController.ts: Fixed TypeScript undefined errors with null checks for viewElement"
    ]
  },
  "validation": "TypeScript compilation successful after fixing undefined errors, system ready for testing in VS Code webview - need to validate sidebar builds dynamically and navigation works",
  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "TypeScript strict null checking flagged viewElement could be undefined after renderView() call",

      "severity": "low"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Sidebar template loading removed - was loading static Sidebar.html, now builds HTML dynamically from scratch",

      "severity": "medium"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Need to handle legacy template loading for header - header still uses static template while sidebar is dynamic",
      "solution": "Keep header template loading as-is (AppHeader.html), only sidebar is dynamic since features define sidebar items",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "low"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Feature manifest hardcoded in FeatureBootstrap.js - not loading from external JSON files yet",
