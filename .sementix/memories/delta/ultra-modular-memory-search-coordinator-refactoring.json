"summary": "Monolithic 221-line MemorySearchCoordinator → Ultra-modular architecture with 12 focused micro-components averaging 27 lines each, perfect for 3D neural network visualization",
"root_cause": "Single large coordinator handling multiple responsibilities: service initialization, state management, API delegation, lifecycle operations, and configuration - difficult to visualize, test, and maintain as discrete neural network nodes",

"solution": {
"approach": "Deep 4-level modular extraction with types/state/initialization/delegation/lifecycle separation, each component representing a specialized neural node with perfect encapsulation",
