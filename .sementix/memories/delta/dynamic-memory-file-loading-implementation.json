  "summary": "Hardcoded 39-file array causing 403 errors and sync issues → Dynamic bridge-based loading from .sementix/memories/delta with VS Code API singleton management",
  "root_cause": "MemoryLoader used hardcoded array of 39 files while actual .sementix/memories/delta contained 48 files, plus multiple VSCodeBridge instances causing VS Code API acquisition conflicts",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Implement dynamic file discovery via VS Code extension bridge with proper singleton management and fallback mechanisms",
    "key_changes": [
      "VSCodeBridge.js: Added getMemoryFiles() method following bridge pattern, implemented singleton pattern with static instance management",
      "MemoryLoader.js: Replaced hardcoded file array with async getAllMemoryFiles() using bridge, added cached results and global instance management",
      "TestRunner.js: Updated getAllMemoryFiles() call to await async method for dynamic file list retrieval"
