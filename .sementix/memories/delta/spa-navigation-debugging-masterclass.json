  "summary": "NavigationController class undefined causing SPA initialization failure → Systematic environment investigation revealing WebView bundling + script timing issues",
  "root_cause": "VS Code WebView serves dist/webview-bundle.html (not source index.html) + NavigationController script loading after SPAInitializer dependency check + cache-busting query parameters breaking WebView file serving",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Complete environment mapping strategy: understand build pipeline, identify bundling disconnect, fix script serving, add timing safeguards",
    "key_changes": [
      "index.html: Removed problematic ?v=spa3-fixed query parameter from NavigationController script tag that was breaking WebView serving",
      "index.html: Added 100ms setTimeout delay with NavigationController availability logging before SPAInitializer runs to resolve script loading race condition",
      "Build Process: Identified and executed pnpm run build:webview to regenerate dist/webview-bundle.html with latest source changes"

  "validation": "Added comprehensive dependency checking with specific NavigationController availability logging, confirmed successful SPA initialization with working sidebar navigation events",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Modified source files but changes not reflected because VS Code serves bundled dist/webview-bundle.html, not source index.html",

The breakthrough came from user realizing 'Claude needs more data' and systematically mapping build pipeline, serving context, and timing dependencies. Always investigate: What's actually being served? What's the loading order? What's the execution timing?",
