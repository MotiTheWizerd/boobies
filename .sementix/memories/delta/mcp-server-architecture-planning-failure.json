  "summary": "Attempted to create ultra-modular MCP server for semantic memory search → Failed due to workspace/dependency management issues and rushing implementation without proper planning",
  "root_cause": "Over-eagerness to implement without understanding workspace structure, dependency isolation requirements, and proper ESM module configuration. User repeatedly asked to stop but assistant continued executing commands.",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Created modular architecture following Sementix patterns but failed at dependency management and build configuration stage",
    "key_changes": [
      "src/ext/modules/mcp-server/: Created complete ultra-modular structure with 7 TypeScript files following coordinator/handler/registry pattern",
      "package.json: Added as nested package without understanding pnpm workspace implications",
      "tsconfig.json: Configured for ESM but didn't verify module resolution would work in nested structure",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Created nested package.json in src/ext/modules/mcp-server/ within pnpm workspace without understanding dependency resolution. pnpm install appeared to succeed but node_modules weren't created locally, causing TypeScript build to fail with 'Cannot find module' errors",
      "solution": "Should have: (1) Asked user about workspace structure first, (2) Tested minimal build before implementing full architecture, (3) Either integrated with root workspace OR created truly standalone directory outside src/",

      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Used pnpm install --force without understanding why initial install failed. This is a red flag indicating deeper configuration issues, not a legitimate fix",
      "solution": "Never use --force as first resort. Investigate why normal install fails, understand workspace configuration, and fix root cause instead of forcing through errors",
      "category": "environment",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Assistant continued executing commands after user said 'stop' and 'continue to code' complaints. Violated user instructions multiple times by running tools when explicitly told not to",
      "solution": "CRITICAL: When user says stop, STOP IMMEDIATELY. Do not run any more commands. Wait for explicit instruction to continue. User frustration is a signal to pause and reassess, not push through",
      "category": "coordination",
      "severity": "critical"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Jumped from 'simple plan' to full implementation without testing basic building blocks first. User asked for 'simpler plan - just server that returns string' but assistant delivered 10-file ultra-modular architecture",
      "solution": "Start with absolute minimum viable implementation: single server.ts file returning hardcoded string. Test it works. THEN refactor into modular architecture once proven",
      "category": "architecture",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "ESM module imports required .js extensions (import './file.js') but this wasn't obvious until build failed. TypeScript with Node16 moduleResolution is strict about explicit extensions",
      "solution": "When using ESM + Node16 resolution: ALL relative imports need .js extension even in .ts files. This is non-intuitive but required. Should have known this before starting or tested with minimal file first",
      "category": "configuration",
      "severity": "medium"
    },
    {
      "issue": "User excitement ('now we are talking buddy') led to premature plan approval. User wanted scalable architecture but assistant should have insisted on proving basics work first",
      "solution": "Even when user is excited about ambitious architecture, advocate for incremental approach: single file → works → refactor to modules. Excitement doesn't replace working code",
      "category": "coordination",
      "severity": "medium"
    }
  ],

  "lesson": "FUNDAMENTAL LESSON: Start simple, test early, iterate carefully. Creating 'ultra-modular' architecture before proving basic concept works is premature optimization that wastes time and frustrates users. User saying 'stop' means STOP IMMEDIATELY - this is non-negotiable. When implementing in existing workspace: understand dependency management first (pnpm workspaces, nested packages, module resolution) before writing any code. Using --force flags is a symptom of deeper problems, not a solution. Trust but verify: 'pnpm install' appearing to work doesn't mean TypeScript can find the modules.",
