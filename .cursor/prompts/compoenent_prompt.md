Part 1: Component Documentation
Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the following:

What the component is used for

How it works, including its structure, inputs (props), outputs (events or return values), and any relevant internal logic.

Use clear language and include code examples where helpful.

Part 2: Implementation Instructions
Write step-by-step instructions for implementing and using the component in a project. Cover everything from:

Where the component file should go.

How to import and integrate it.

Any dependencies or required props.

Optional configuration or customizations.

Real-world usage examples.

Final Step: Save the Files

Let me know when you're ready for me to apply this to a specific component — just share the code or idea and I’ll take it from there!
